# MLP
A (M)ulti (L)ayer (P)erceptron program for the assignment in the class Connectionist Computing.

MAIN:
 The main class of this java project contains the bulk of the testing required for the assignment.
 It will create files on your device showing average error through different numbers of epochs
  for each test.

 The "tests" of this project are not JUnit tests seperate from main as it was explicitly stated that
  the professor should be able to compile and run the project and see the results in files.
  thus no JUnit tests to allow as such.

REPORT:
 The report contains the details of the project and its level of success, along with places that
 could be improved and the things I learned during the project.

 Please read the report for more detail if you are interested.

 TLDR:
  This particular MLP neural network was very good at creating a working XOR, or other 
   mathematical calculations like the sine of vectors test.

  It did however struggle with image recognition, likely due to a mismatch between the programming
   and the type of input / output.

  If there is time, I hope to expand the number of tests done and refine the design.
